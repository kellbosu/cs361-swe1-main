CS361 SWE1 Final project.  Microservices B, C, D, & A.

How to request data:
    Upon starting 'sport_main.py', the user will be prompted with a series of possible commands. 
    To request a random sport fact, the user need only enter 'random'.
    To request a fact from a specific sport or team, the user need only enter 'select', then the user will be prompted to enter the desired sport and/ or team they wish to receive a sport fact about. The user also has the option to enter 'random' for team or sport at any time. 

    EXAMPLE:
        "ENTER: 'random' for a random sport fact.
         ENTER: 'select' to choose a sport or team.
         ENTER: 'quit' to exit."

         "Enter a command:" 'random'

How to receive data:
    Upon entering the above described commands, the program will then fetch a random sport fact under whichever user parameters have been specified and print it out in the CLI. 

    EXAMPLE:
        "Sport: baseball.
         Team: san francisco giants
         Fact: The team has won 8 World Series titles."
